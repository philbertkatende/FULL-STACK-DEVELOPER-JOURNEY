	<h1>The Pear</h1>
	<img src="../images/pear.jpg" alt="pear" style="width:auto; height:auto;">
	<p>My story with pears has always been a blissful one, because of their teasty nature and them being a first degree relative of an apple</p>
	<p>When I was young, we used to eat pears in a given season though I don't remember the exact months of these seasons.</p>
	<p>Overtime these apple brothers dissappeared, and they were no more, my be they exited but in a distant univrse one that wasn't walked by me.</p>
