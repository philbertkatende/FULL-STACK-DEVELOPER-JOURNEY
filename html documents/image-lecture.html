	<h1 id="TOP">The Billioniare's Journey</h1>
	<p>By 25, I was still under my mom's wing, but many, by this age are let loose by their parents. I was in my confort zone, everything provided by here. It felt like I was a helpless person, because why would an adult male of soo much potential have nothing to his name at that age?</p>
	<p>My motivational speaker would say that everyone runs their race, but my perception about life had change and all I wanted was to get a billion and no human can get it in his conformat zone. I had to leave and go pave my own billion journey.</p>
	<p>At the time, I was in internship and I final year to become a lisenced and registered Pharmacist. I decided to learn coding and started with HTML, but all this was to distract myself from my own shortcoming of lack of skills and incompetence, this gave a short time gratification but it wasn't enough because every fleating though was the one of a billion.</p>
	<p>How would I get it? How would I start after wasting a lot of my money, my financial indiscpline was partly contributing to my feeling of worthlessness.</p>
	<p>I got a mentality of investing every shilling I got, at times it was impulsive, but I loved every bit of it because my atitude towards money had changed, I was no longer spending but investing and I started asking myself, HOW DO I INVEST IT??!!!</p>
	<h2>THE BREAKTHROUGH</h2>
    <p>I set a goal of saving a billion shilling in the next five years in 2025, meaning I had to have a billion by 30, a billion shilling and assests by 30! Around 4 billions by 30!</p>
    <p>With such ambitiousness, I had to sacrifice more than sweat, I had to fight with the Lion.</p>
