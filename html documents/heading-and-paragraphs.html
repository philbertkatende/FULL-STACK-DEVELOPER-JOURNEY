<h4>The War That Followed Home</h4>
<pre style="color:#345678;">
They once stood smiling
a soldier and his bride,
eyes full of tomorrow,
hearts unscarred by war.

But war took him whole
and returned him in fragments
thin, haunted, breathing but not living.
“Don’t come in,” he whispered,
“I still ain’t out of there.”

The battle had followed him home
in silence, in shadows,
in wounds no eye could see.
She tried to love him whole,
but some battles never end.

Now he walks through each day
like a ghost of peace long lost,
and she stands beside him,
loving what remains.

Some wars end in gunfire
others live forever inside.
